Do not be afraid to com­mit acts for which you might be blamed di­rect­ly, so long as you do so rarely, and as long as you have a plau­si­ble ex­cuse: you dropped your wrench across an elec­tric cir­cuit be­cause an air raid had kept you up the night be­fore and you were half-doz­ing at work. Fre­quent­ly you can get away with such acts un­der the cov­er of pre­tend­ing stu­pid­i­ty, over­cau­tion, fear of be­ing sus­pect­ed of sab­o­tage, or weak­ness and dull­ness due to un­der­nour­ish­ment. Af­ter you have com­mit­ted an act of easy sab­o­tage, re­sist any temp­ta­tion to wait around and see what hap­pens. Loi­ter­ers arouse sus­pi­cion.
